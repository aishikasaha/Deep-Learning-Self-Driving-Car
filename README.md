The the goal of behavioral cloning is to collect data while exhibiting good behavior and then train a model to mimic that behavior with the collected data. 
This project makes use of Udacity's open source car simulator to generate image dataset by behavioral cloning.

## Tools Used:
```
PIL
SciKit-learn
Keras
Tensorflow
Numpy
Pandas
OpenCV
Matplotlib
```

## Files:
* Download the simulator for your operating system from [here: ](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)
To run the simulation, open ```Command Prompt``` or ```terminal```.
```shell
$ cd Self_Driving_Car
$ python drivercode.py
```
Now open the simulation, and click on autonomous mode. The socket connection feeds in real time predictions of steering angle, throttle and speed from 3 cameras mounted on windshield of the car.
